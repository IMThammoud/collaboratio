# Collaboratio

### WebApp with different approach to teamwork

##### -> Prepared some HTML Templates to be served with MVC
##### -> implemented Login Basics
##### -> User Registration Works now
##### -> Need to figure out a way to Manage Sessions so a User can create a Collaboratio-Session and be the Host of it.
##### ---> Need to implement Environment variables, but DB-Connection is denied when using the ENVs. Maybe they are not recognized?
